Description: Peercoin P2P digital currency.
 .
 Peercoin is a crypto-currency project forked from Bitcoin and we aim to achieve
 energy-efficiency and keep as much as possible the original Bitcoin's
 preferable properties.
 .
 Full transaction history (blockchain) is stored locally at each client. This
 requires about 1 GB of free disk space.
 .
 This package provides both the daemon, ppcoind and QT based graphical wallet.
